## Contracts

The `contracts/MyContract.sol` file contains the Solidity code for the ERC-20 token contract. It imports the necessary contracts and libraries from the `@openzeppelin/contracts` library.

## Deployment Script

The `scripts/deploy.js` file contains the deployment script for the ERC-20 token contract. It uses Hardhat and the `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers` library to deploy the contract on the localhost network.

## Tests

The `test/MyContract.test.js` file contains the tests for the ERC-20 token contract. It uses the Hardhat testing framework to write and run tests against the deployed contract.

## Hardhat Configuration

The `hardhat.config.js` file is the configuration file for Hardhat. It specifies the Solidity version, the network settings for localhost, and the plugins used in the project.

## Package Configuration

The `package.json` file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
